The problems in these homework sets are examples from an 6th grade Pre-Algebra course using the Prentice-Hall textbook "Pre-Algebra:  Tools for a Changing World" published in 2001.  They likely do not provide an exhaustive review of every type of problem but cover a large number.

Once each problem is worked correctly by a student, the problem can be re-randomized and attempted again with new values for double checking.
